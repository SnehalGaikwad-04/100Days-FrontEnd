# Sigma-Course-Daily-Code-Journey

Description:
Welcome to my daily code journey as I progress through the Sigma course! This repository is dedicated to documenting my learning process and sharing the code I write each day as part of the course. Expect to find a variety of topics covered, including Java language, front-end development, Algorithms and Data Structures (DSA) and MERN stack development.

What's Included:
Front-End Development: Code samples, tutorials, and projects related to front-end web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and popular frameworks/libraries.
Java Language: Code snippets, projects, and exercises related to Java programming.
Algorithms and Data Structures (DSA): Implementations of common algorithms and data structures in various programming languages.
MERN Stack Development: Projects and code examples focusing on building applications using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.
