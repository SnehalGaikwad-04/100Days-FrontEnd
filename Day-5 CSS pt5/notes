justify-content: This property defines how flex items are aligned along the main axis of the flex container. The main axis is determined by the flex-direction property. */
justify-content has several possible values:

flex-start: Items are packed toward the start of the main axis.
flex-end: Items are packed toward the end of the main axis.
center: Items are centered along the main axis.
space-between: Items are evenly distributed along the main axis with the first item at the start and the last item at the end.
space-around: Items are evenly distributed along the main axis with equal space around them.
space-evenly: Items are evenly distributed along the main axis with equal space around them, including before the first item and after the last item.



align-content has similar values to justify-content, but they apply to the cross axis:

flex-start: Lines are packed toward the start of the cross axis.
flex-end: Lines are packed toward the end of the cross axis.
center: Lines are centered along the cross axis.
space-between: Lines are evenly distributed along the cross axis with the first line at the start and the last line at the end.
space-around: Lines are evenly distributed along the cross axis with equal space around them.
stretch: Lines stretch to fill the remaining space along the cross axis.
