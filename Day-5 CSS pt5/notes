Flexbox, or Flexible Box Layout, is a CSS layout model that allows you to design more flexible and efficient layouts in a container. It's particularly useful for building complex, responsive layouts.
.flex-container {
    display: flex;
}

Flex Direction: You can change the direction of the main axis using the flex-direction property. Options include row (default), row-reverse, column, and column-reverse.
.flex-container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column; /* lays out items vertically */
}

justify-content: This property defines how flex items are aligned along the main axis of the flex container. The main axis is determined by the flex-direction property.
justify-content has several possible values:

flex-start: Items are packed toward the start of the main axis.
flex-end: Items are packed toward the end of the main axis.
center: Items are centered along the main axis.
space-between: Items are evenly distributed along the main axis with the first item at the start and the last item at the end.
space-around: Items are evenly distributed along the main axis with equal space around them.
space-evenly: Items are evenly distributed along the main axis with equal space around them, including before the first item and after the last item.

align-content has similar values to justify-content, but they apply to the cross axis:

flex-start: Lines are packed toward the start of the cross axis.  
flex-end: Lines are packed toward the end of the cross axis.
center: Lines are centered along the cross axis.
space-between: Lines are evenly distributed along the cross axis with the first line at the start and the last line at the end.
space-around: Lines are evenly distributed along the cross axis with equal space around them.
stretch: Lines stretch to fill the remaining space along the cross axis.

Flex Wrap: By default, flex items will try to fit onto one line. You can control wrapping behavior with the flex-wrap property, allowing items to wrap onto multiple lines.
.flex-container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap; /* allows items to wrap onto multiple lines */
}

Flex Grow, Shrink, and Basis: These properties control how flex items grow, shrink, and their initial size. They're controlled through the flex shorthand property.
.flex-item {
    flex: 1 1 auto; /* flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis */
}
